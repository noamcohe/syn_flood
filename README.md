Malicious agents try to perform Denial of service on us using
SYN-Flood attack.
The attack comes from a large number of IP addresses.
We were chosen to head the team of defenders - we have at our disposal the branch file that was recorded in the process
The attacker and we wrote a Python script that identifies the IP addresses of the attackers
And saves them to a file
